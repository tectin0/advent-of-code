## Preparation

- Download and Install [Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)](https://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html)
  - There seems to be different versions of LISP - sbcl was just the first one I found
  - Scripts can be run with `sbcl --script <script>`
- Download and Install [Quicklisp Packagemanager](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
  - I couldn't figure out (didn't want to spend more time writing lisp) how to do certain things without packages

## Thoughts

- There seems to be a specific "workflow" that is expected when using LISP (using Emacs and Slime) - which I won't follow - so take my thoughts with a grain of salt
- I've never seen a worse syntax in my life
- Error messages are a complete joke
- ((((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))))
