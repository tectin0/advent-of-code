## Preparation

- Download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
  - GUI and CLI version
  - (Optional) make symlink for CLI version (godotc) and add to PATH
  - scripts can be run with `godot --script --headless <script>` also `--debug` for debugger

## Thoughts

- Download/Installation is easy and straight forward (there is no installation)
- Running script with debugger automatically stops on error and lets you inspect the stack - cool
- Pretty smooth experience for not being necessarily intended for single script execution
- Syntax is fine
- No type system is not nice
