## Preparation

- Install Rad Studio (don't)
  - go to [embarcadero](https://www.embarcadero.com/)
  - pay with your data or with $1000+ (and you data)

## Thoughts

### Installation

- they want your full name, country, email, phone number, company name
  - did not find any way to download a compiler without giving them "my" data
  - they did not check for valid phone number but they do send you a serial number by email
- command line does not work with the community edition (absolute joke)

### IDE (Rad Studio)

- some extremely unresponsive windows
- did freeze on me once (in 15 min of usage)
- fairly direct copy of Visual Studio
- fine ui overall

### Language

- archaic syntax
- useless error messages
- decent debugging experience
