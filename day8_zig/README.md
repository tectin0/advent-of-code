## Preparation

- Download and Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig)

## Thoughts

- a lot of files and folders are created by default
- very nice error message
  - for the most part &rarr; sometimes it just tells you "well I died - idk"
- decent amount of information on the internet
- not everything seems to work how you expect it to
  - it is probably fine if you already now those things but trying to figure it out is a bit frustrating
- it feels like the language prioritizes "I'm different" over "I'm fun to use"
