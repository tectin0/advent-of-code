## Preparation

- Download [Alire](https://ada-lang.io/)
  - Alire = Ada package manager + Ada project manager + Ada toolchain manager
- Install [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/)
- (Optional) VSCode Ada & Spark Extension
  - The extension does not like when the ada project root is not the same as the vscode workspace root &rarr; have to set the ada project root in `settings.json`

## Thoughts

- A lot of outdated information on the internet
- Alire does work fairly well
- Soo many files and folders for a simple hello world program
- Nice error messages
- Fairly ugly syntax
- Really long compile time
- Typed is good
- Barely any information on how to use the language
