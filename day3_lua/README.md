## Preparation

- Download and install [Lua binaries](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/) with an optional "full Lua installer"
- (Optional) Add the Lua binary path to the PATH environment variable

## Thoughts

- Installer is nice and works immediately
- Pretty low delay between command input to code execution
- No type system is not nice
- Syntax is fine
- VSCode extensions are nice
  - linting
  - code completion
  - debugging
- Error messages are "ok"
  - I did not have many errors though
